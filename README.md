		<p> First;
			Create Roles using PhpMyAdmin
			- name : Admin | slug: admin
			- name : Author | slug: author
		</p>
		<p> Second; (only for 1st User)
			After You create a User; go to Users Table and then add role_id - 1;
			Then the user will be Admin; and log in to Admin Panel; http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
			There is no default role;
